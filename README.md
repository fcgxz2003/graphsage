# Graphsage
This directory contains code necessary to run the GraphSage algorithm. 
GraphSage can be viewed as a stochastic generalization of graph convolutions, 
and it is especially useful for massive, dynamic graphs that contain rich feature information. 

# Quick Start
You can follow the steps below to quickly get up and running with graphsage models. 
These steps will let you run quick inference locally.


# Requirements
```
cudatoolkit      11.2.2
cudnn            8.1.0.77
tensorflow-gpu   2.6.0
```

# Running the code

```
python test.py
```
